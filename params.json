  "body": "# PowerShell KeePass\r\n[PoShKeePass](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PoShKeePass) is a PowerShell module that combines the ease of the PowerShell cli and the extensibility of the [KeePassLib API](http://keepass.info/help/v2/setup.html) to provide a powerful and easy to use management and automating platform for [KeePass](http://keepass.info/) databases.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n1. **Database Configuration Profiles** - Supports mutliple databases and authentication options.\r\n2. **Getting, Creating, Updating, and Removing KeePass Entries and Groups** - All of these perform as much automatic database authentication as possible using the database configuration profile. For databases that use a masterkey (password) it will prompt for it.\r\n3. **Generating KeePass Passwords** - Supports most character sets and advanced keepass options. Also supports creating password profiles that can be specified to create a new password with the same rule set.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n### Install\r\n```powershell\r\nInstall-Module -Name PoShKeePass\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nPlease check out our [Getting Started](https://github.com/PSKeePass/PoShKeePass/wiki/Getting-Started) documentation on our [wiki](https://github.com/PSKeePass/PoShKeePass/wiki).\r\n\r\n## Important Notes & Reminders\r\n1. Please always keep up to date **backups** of your KeePass database files .kdbx and .key files.\r\n2. The module uses the KeePassLib 2.3.x which is embedded in the module file.\r\n3. This module was built and tested in PowerShell 5 on Windows 10 but should work in PowerShell 4 and Windows 8.1 and Server 2012 R2 and up. It may work in some earlier versions but is currently untested and not supported. If you come across issues create an issue and I will look into fixing it or create a pull request.\r\n4. There is an underlying framework that I wrote into the module to make all of the api calls that I will eventually expose for advanced scripting.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\nPlease review the [changelog document](https://github.com/PSKeePass/PoShKeePass/blob/master/changelog.md) for a full history.\r\n\r\n### Changelog PoShKeePass v2.0.4.0\r\n* #108 Fixed bug by capturing PSCredential to MasterKey variable.\r\n\r\n### Changelog PoShKeePass v2.0.3.9\r\n\r\n1. #92 Added PowerShell Format XML File for creating PowerShell Object views.\r\n2. #90 Updated default properties returned for KeePass Entries to Include the Notes Property.
